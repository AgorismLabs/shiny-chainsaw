Minimal submission for ETHGlobal SG

This doesn't do anything. I had a great talk with Mina + zkNoid ppl but failed to connect with a good team and there's no way for me to finish my gamified, funnified and zk-verified real-world interaction app in time. So I'm just submitting this to have something minimal submitted.

My Polish roommate in the hacker house (great guy) insisted on having A/C all night and my throat is sore and the other guys had to disconnect my laptop at night which is also not fun.

Whatever, to be continued in Bangkok. I should work on getting a team ready for that meanwhile.

It's also the time of Rao game round two and I'm focusing on that. Ethereum is nice but BitTensor is better. Vitalik doesn't want to scale mainnet for whatever reason (L2 kickbacks? technical issues?) while Const is very enthusiastic about Dynamic Tao and it will probably happen.

I would really like zk features on mainnet, why doesn't it happen or even in the plans that I heard? Smart wallets and L2s are fun but are not the thing I want. I want scalable mainnet please.
